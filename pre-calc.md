### Functions and Their Properties
#### What is a function?
A function typically refers to a mapping or assingment of values from one set to another set. 

The set that is used as the input is called the domain of the function. The resultant set output by the function is called the codomain.

Not all equations are functions. 

$$
f(x) = c
$$

where $$f(x)$$ represents a generic funciton f with an input of x

### Parent Functions
### Linear Functions and Equations

$$
f(x) = mx + b
$$

### Quadratic Functions and Equations


$$x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}$$


### Inequalities and Continunity


### Polynomial Functions and Equations

$$
f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 0 
$$
