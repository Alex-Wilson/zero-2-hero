### First Principels 

A set is a well-defined collection containing abstract objects called the elements of the set.

Consider the set $s$, which contains all the english characters that are used to represent the word "johnny". The set $s$ would contain the elements: 'j','o','h','n','y'. **Notice that we include/add/count ONLY the DISTINCT elements of a set.**

This set $s$ meets our definition of well defined because we can verify if a given english character, like "x", is in the word or not. Simply visit all elements in the set and see if one of them is 'x'. For the set $s$ this is not true but for another set it may be true. Regardless there is a way to prove it IS a member of a given set or is NOT a member of that same given given set. 

We could not, for example, have a set like the set $i$, which contains all the of the english characters that I think are cool, because that would involve some form of prejudice, which is something that cannot be determined universaly.

We have described the set $s$ using written language, which is often the first step to writing a formal definition to a set, but there are other more formal ways!

**Roster Method:** Set $s$ = {j,o,h,n,y} 
**Set-Builder Method:** $s$ = {$x$ | $x$ is a letter in johnny} 

When we are reading the set builder method we would say, something like $s$ is the set which contains $x$ such that $x$ is a letter in johnny". That bar roughly translates to "such that" in english.

Lets also formalize our concept of well-defined. 

We can write $j \in s$ to state that 'j' is contained in the word 'johnny'.

Alternatively we can say $q \notin s$ to state that 'q' is NOT contained in the word 'johnny'.

These symbols allow us to start thinking about how we can state if an item is in a set or not.



Lets talk about the most important sets!

**The Empty Set: $\empty$ = { } = {x  | x $\neq$ x }**
This set contains nothing. It is like the zero of the set world however lots of sets only contain 0. Do not confuse {0} with { }. They are very different. 

**The Set of Natural Numbers: \(\mathbb{N}\) = {1,2,3,...}**
This set contains the empty set and all of the of the natural numbers. 1,2,3 and so forth.

**The Set of Whole Numbers: \(\mathbb{W}\) = {0,1,2,3,...}**
This set contains the empty set, the natural numbers, and zero. 0,1,2,3 and so forth.

**The Set of Integer Numbers: \(\mathbb{Z}\) = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}**
This set contains the empty set, the natural numbers, the whole numbers, and the negative counterparts of those numbers. 

**The Set of Rational Numbers: \(\mathbb{Q}\) = $\left\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a \in \mathbb{Z} \ \text{and } b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$**

This set contains the empty set, the natural numbers, the whole numbers, the integers, and those numbers that can be expressed by the quotient (or ratio) of two integers (provided the denominator is not zero!). Think of numbers that are represented by a repeating or terminaiting decimal. Examples include -1, -0.$\overline{333}$, 0, 0.5, and 1.

**The Set of Irrational Numbers:**

This set contains only those numbers that are real (explained below) and cannot be expressed by the quotient of two integers because they have representations that do not repeat or terminate. Think of these numbers as inifnitely percise numbers like $\sqrt{2}$ or $2\pi$.
 

**The Set of Real Numbers: \(\mathbb{R}\) = {x | x can be pointed to on a number line}**
This set contains the empty set, the natural numbers, the whole numbers, the integers, the rational numbers and irrational numbers.  This set contains any number that has a decimal component. All of these numbers have an imaginary component of zero. They can all be mapped onto a number line, even if the number line requires constant update.

**The Set of Complex Numbers: \(\mathbb{R}\) = {x | x can be pointed to on a number line}**














**Function:** A function is a special relation between two sets of numbers where each element of the input (the domain) corresponds with exactly one element in the output (resultant set or codomain). Think of this as a useful case of mapping.

An example might look like:

$$
f(x) = c
$$

where $f(x)$ represents a generic funciton $f$ with an input of $x$










### Parent Functions

- Linear Functions | $f(x) = mx + b$
- Quadratic Functions | $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
- Cubic Functions | $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$
- Absolute Value Functions | $f(x) = |x| $
- Square Root Functions | $f(x) =\sqrt{x}$
- Exponential Functions | $f(x) = c^x$
- Logarithmic Functions | $f(x) = \ln{x}$
- Rational Functions | $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ or $ x^{-1}$
